Q1. express.static(path.join()) working locally not working in github pages
Solution:
__________________________________________________________________________________

If express.static(path.join()) is working locally but not working when deployed to 
GitHub Pages, it's likely that the issue is related to how you are deploying your 
application to GitHub Pages. When you deploy your application to GitHub Pages, 
GitHub Pages only serves static files from certain directories. By default, 
it serves files from the root directory and the "docs" folder. So if your static 
files are stored in a directory other than these two, GitHub Pages will not serve 
them.To fix this issue, you'll need to tell GitHub Pages to serve files from your 
"public" folder instead. You can do this by adding a gh-pages branch to your 
repository, with the "public" folder as the root directory. Here are the steps you 
can follow:

Install the gh-pages package by running npm install --save-dev gh-pages in your 
project directory.

Add a homepage field to your package.json file, with the URL of your GitHub Pages 
site. For example: "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/repository-name/"

Add a deploy script to your package.json file, with the following command:

"deploy": "gh-pages -d public"

This command tells gh-pages to deploy the "public" folder to the gh-pages branch.

Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

Run the npm run deploy command to deploy your application to GitHub Pages.

$npm run deploy

After following these steps, your static files should be served correctly from 
the "public" folder on your GitHub Pages site
